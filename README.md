# MachineLearning
Machine Learning project about YouTube Trending videos

How to run the code:
1) Add a directory named "Data" to where the code is. Download the youtube data from here (https://www.kaggle.com/datasnaek/youtube-new),
and extract the zip to the directory "Data" (file was too big to upload to Github).
2) Run the Main script.
3) A really intuitive UI will open up and you can choose which part of the code you want to run,
  and with which countires' data.
  
* The PCA algorithms work only on the USA, Great Britain, Germany, Canada, and   France data sets, as the other are newer and formatted a bit differently.
* The DBScan implementation of Scikit-Learn is very heavy and we couldnâ€™t run it with the whole data, so we used a 10,000 sample to run on. 
* We fixed the random seed to 0

Enjoy!
